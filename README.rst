lessArcane
===========
With lessArcane you can share your gists dumped from gistbox
as a browseable library.
`lessArcane.js` is written in coffeescript and compiled to js.

We edit the resulting output just slightly by setting the json equal to 
a variable called `data`. If you look at the first line of our `sample.json`
you'll see what we did.

The `sample.json` file is called by `index.html` and processed by `lessArcane.js`
